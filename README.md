Project Name 1: Equipment Firmware Verification with Blockchain and Cryptography
File Name: firmware_auth_hashlib
Description:

This Python code demonstrates a basic framework for verifying equipment firmware integrity using a combination of blockchain and cryptographic techniques. It simulates the following processes:

Firmware Hashing: Calculates a SHA-256 hash of the firmware code to ensure its integrity.
Blockchain Registration: Stores firmware hashes on a simulated blockchain (not a real, decentralized blockchain).
Boot-Up Verification: Checks firmware integrity during equipment boot-up by comparing the calculated hash with the hash stored on the blockchain.
Cryptographic Signing and Verification: Uses public key cryptography to sign firmware hashes and verify their authenticity.
Key Features:

Class-based structure for firmware, equipment, blockchain, and cryptographic verification.
Sample usage demonstrating a manufacturing process, equipment initialization, blockchain registration, boot-up verification, and cryptographic signing/verification.
Requirements:

Python 3.6+
cryptography library (install with pip install cryptography)
Disclaimers:

This is a simplified example and does not implement a real blockchain. It uses a simulated blockchain for demonstration purposes.
It does not cover key management, error handling, or security best practices for real-world deployments.
The sample usage contains placeholder values for serial numbers, firmware code, and cryptographic keys.
Further Development:

Integrate with a real blockchain platform for robust decentralized verification.
Implement robust key management and security measures.
Add error handling and logging for production use.
Expand functionality to cover firmware updates and rollbacks.
How to Use:

Install required libraries: pip install cryptography
Replace placeholder values in the if __name__ == "__main__": block with actual data.
Run the code: python firmware_verification.py
Notes:

The sign_with_private_key and verify_with_public_key functions are placeholders and need to be implemented using the chosen cryptographic library (e.g., cryptography).
Properly manage cryptographic keys in a secure manner for real-world use.
I hope this overview is helpful! Feel free to adapt and build upon this code for your specific needs.

Project Name 2: OpenRAN Equipment Node Initialization with Blockchain Verification
File_Name: openran_equipment_verifiaction_web3
Description:

This Python program implements the Equipment Node Initialization process described in Section III.D of a paper discussing blockchain-based security for OpenRAN equipment.
It simulates connecting to a Quorum blockchain and sending a serial number and firmware hash for verification using a smart contract.

Purpose:

This code serves as a demonstration of the core flow for verifying equipment authenticity and integrity in OpenRAN networks using blockchain technology. 
It showcases how Python libraries like web3.py can interact with a permissioned blockchain like Quorum.

Requirements:

Python 3.6+
web3.py library (install with pip install web3)
Access to a Quorum blockchain network and deployed smart contract (not included in this code)

Replace placeholders:
Update quorum_provider with your Quorum node RPC endpoint.
Replace contract_address with the actual address of your deployed smart contract.
Modify YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY with your private key for interacting with the contract.
Ensure the verifyEquipment function call matches your contract's arguments and return values.
Run the program:
Execute python openran_equipment_verifiaction_web3.py.
Observe output:
The program will simulate sending a transaction with the equipment data and wait for confirmation.
It will then print a message indicating successful verification or potential issues.

Project Name 3: OpenRAN Equipment Verification - Simulation Testing
File_Name: quorum_mock_verification
Description:

This Python code implements unit tests for the equipment node initialization process outlined in Section V of a paper discussing secure OpenRAN using blockchain. 
It simulates interactions with a Quorum blockchain and smart contract without requiring a live network, aiding in testing the core verification logic.

Features:

Mock interactions with a Quorum blockchain using web3.py.
Unit tests for successful and failed verification scenarios.
Coverage of key functionality like transaction sending, receipt handling, and response validation.
Requirements:

Python 3.6+
web3.py library (install with pip install web3)
pytest testing framework (install with pip install pytest)
Usage:

Modify the code in test_equipment_verification.py to match your specific implementation details:
Update quorum_provider with your mock provider configuration.
Replace sample equipment_data with valid or invalid test cases.
Adapt verify_equipment call based on your smart contract function.
Run the tests:
Execute pytest test_equipment_verification.py.
Observe results:
The tests will report success or failure based on expected outcomes.
